                    Hello --<br />
                    From my family to yours, we wish you Happy New Year!

                    As we are entering in the New Year, we find ourselves reflecting on the past year,
                    and our thoughts turn gratefully to those who have helped, shape our business and made our
                    continued success possible. Year-end finds many of us reflecting on the past year,
                    both from a personal as well as a professional perspective. We value our relationship with you,
                    and look forward to working with you in the year to come. We also think about what may have gone wrong,
                    and what changes we want to make in the coming year to live better, be happier and get healthier.


                </p>
                <p style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:12pt;line-height:22px;text-align:justify;">
                    This New Year we thank you for providing us the opportunity to serve you and we promise to make your experience a satisfying and enriching one in the coming days.
                </p>
